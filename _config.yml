          This research project is further developed to my PhD dissertation, part of the work is published as US patent.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I developed a GIS expert system by integrating machine learning models (GLM, RF, GBM) with rule-based system for improving wetland classification accuracy.
          
          I built data pipeline to download and process satellite data, derived terrain data from <mark>LiDAR</mark>, I also utilized ArcGIS Model Builder to orchestra the data processing and model running to minimize the manual work.
          The classification accuracy was increased from around 50% to 90%.

          I helped construct an internal web portal on AWS for domain experts to access data and visualize statisical analysis results.
          I implemented a <mark>WPS</mark> chain to provide basic spatial analysis functions using <mark>CURL</mark> and GeoServer Rest APIs.
          
          The tech stack I used for the website includes <mark>EC2</mark>, <mark>Tomcat</mark>, <mark>GeoServer</mark>, <mark>OpenLayers</mark>, <mark>JavaScript</mark>, and <mark>PHP</mark>.
